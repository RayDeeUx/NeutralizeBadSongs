# NeutralizeBadSongs
"Ban" song IDs (or "ban" all songs from an artist) from playing inside a level, and play your own preferred background music instead.
Think of the Blacklist feature from Menu Loop Randomizer and the song replacement mechanisms from Jukebox having a child.

Useful for:
- Ignoring all songs from a specific artist (looking at you, G\*\*x\*r).
- Skipping the tedium of replacing songs you find boring (since Jukebox requires song metadata for each replacement).

Songs are randomly chosen from (either) this mod's config directory or a single file in your mod settings.

"Banned" song IDs and artists are stored in text files in the config directory as well.

Replacement songs from Jukebox are not "bannable", for obvious reasons.\
Jukebox replacement songs still take priority over replacement songs from this mod's settings.
