# NeutralizeBadSongs
"Ban" song IDs (or "ban" all songs from an artist) and replaces them for your own preferred background music when playing a level.\
Kind of like if the Blacklist feature from Menu Loop Randomizer and the song replacement mechanisms from Jukebox had a child.

Adds a bit of spice to replacing "banned"/boring songs compared to the tedium of keyboard mashing your way through filling replacement song metadata when using Jukebox.

Songs are chosen from your mod settings and from this mod's config directory. "Banned" song IDs and artists are stored in text files from the config directory as well.

Replacement songs from Jukebox are not "bannable", and will still take priority over replacement songs chosen from this mod's config directory.
